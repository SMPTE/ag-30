      <p><a>Software</a> is commonly used in Engineering Documents and
      Registered Disclosure Documents. It can, for example, provide a sample
      implementation of an algorithm or carry large amounts of machine-readable
      data.</p>

      <p>By making the <a>software</a> available under a permissive copyright
      license, its use in implementations, both commercial and open-source,
      is facilitated, and interoperability is therefore enhanced.</p>
